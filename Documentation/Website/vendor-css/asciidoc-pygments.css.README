asciidoc-pygments.css is generated automatically by jekyll-asciidoc but we do not use it.
For some reason the generated code does not result in the same css that is used if you run asciidoc standalone and generate a standalone document.
That code results in better rendered code blocks.
Therefore that code has been copied into vendor-css/asciidoc-pygments-manual.css
That is the css that ve actually use on the page.
