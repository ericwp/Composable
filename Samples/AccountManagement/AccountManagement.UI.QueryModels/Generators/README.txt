These classes implement the ability to create query models ad hoc by using the events from the event store. 

Advantages:
* You don't need to spend time populating/Repopulating the query models.
* * Meaning you can freely refactor the querymodels without worrying about having to repopulate.
* Since events are agressively cached(1) this should be faster than fetching a query model from a document db.

Disadvantages: 
* Increases the risk of locking issues under high multi threaded load.
* Requires the clients to reference the events and the event store.

Recommendation:
I recommend starting out with autogenerated models where possible.
If scalability issues occur refactor to using a document database and query models updaters.


1) Caching events is safe because events never change once created.
