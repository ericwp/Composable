Note how we test only through the public interface of the querying components.
We don't care how the components do their job. Just that they do it correctly.

This means that we can change the implementation completely without these tests breaking. 
For instance we can gradually refactor so that all query models are fetched from a document database without breaking these tests. 
And these tests will fully test that new implementation.

In fact this benefit has been used already. The original implementation used the document db for all query models.
These tests were written for that implementation. They stayed green 99% of the time while refactoring to use autogenerated query models.
Had these tests been written against implementation details that would never have worked and the refactoring would have been much harder.
